# SAA-2017
This is the R code used as part of my SAA 2017 project to generate least cost paths to random points. Further project description and instructions are included in the R script. 

This code has been tested using R Studio on  R 3.3.3 and Microsoft R Open 3.3.2 on Windows 7 and Windows 10.

Suggestions are welcome.
