# SAA-2017
This is the R code used as part of my SAA 2017 project to generate least cost paths to random points. Further project description and instructions are included in the R script. 

This code is designed for R 3.3.3 and has been tested using R Studio on Windows 10.

Suggestions and improvements are welcome.
